***This is a model implementaion form https://github.com/isohrab/Pupil-locator***

**what is this Model**

This Model is a hybrid model inspiered by YOLO, Network in Network (NiN) cnns and using YINInception as the core CNN to predict the pupil location inside the image of the eye.

**Why did you name the techique InceptionNet if thats not what its called?**

The authors of the original paper did not specifiy a name, and since its super close to InceptionNet I just named it that

**How good is this method**

In terms of easy of implementaion and accuracy its currently one of the best methods of eye tracking in this repo

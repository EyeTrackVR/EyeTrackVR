## This page will be an overview of things to know and understand before you start this project.


### Software is not final. 
Bugs can and will occur which may hinder the experience or useability at times.
Do not expect 100% reliable and perfect function.

### Firmware may have user dificulties.
Our firmware has not been tested widely so issues may creep up.

### IR emitters are dangerous.
If handled wrong or precautions are ignored you can and will cause damage to your eyes. Please make sure to only buy linked ones or ones with specs that match exactly. We will not be responsible for damaged caused if you go your own route.

### Documentation may be incomplete.
Important steps may be missing.

### You will need to set up your avatar to use this.
This will require some basic Unity knowledge and owning your own avatar.
